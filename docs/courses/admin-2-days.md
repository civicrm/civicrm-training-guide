# Learn how to administer CiviCRM software in 2 days

## Trainer Notes

### Objectives

* Understand how the CiviCRM community works and where you can find further information and support
* Know how to use CiviCRM as a day to day user
* Be able to plan and configure CiviCRM installations
* Understand the different CiviCRM Modules and how they interact with each other
* Work through practical examples and exercises relating to the course material

### Previous knowledge assumed

* That the learners are familiar with using online software applications / Office based software

### Materials and equipment required

* Each learner should be given; a copy of the Course Timetable, details of each session with the exercises, details on how they access support and access online resources.
* A projector and computer for the trainer to demonstrate the session materials
* Each learner (or pair of learners) will have access to a computer which can connect to a CiviCRM installation. These computers are used by the learner to complete the session exercises.

### Delivery Notes

* The programme below lists a suggested timetable and session order.
* Trainer notes and learner exercises for each session can be found on the CiviCRM Wiki page Sessions
* Some of the sessions are run as half hour sessions only, this means that there are no user exercises included for that session
* The flexible session, Session 12, can be either (Case, Grant or Campaign). You should find out from the learners which one will be the most useful
* Two days is not enough time to each 'everything' so don't try and teach every possibility and avoid information overload.
* In general, it is better to not interrupt people exercises unless there is an important bit of information that needs to be shared amongst learners.  Save recapping till the end.
