### What is a campaign?

A campaign is quite simple. It is like a tag that can be applied all over CiviCRM

- emails
- contribution pages
- activities
- surveys
- petitions

It has a start date and an optional end date

A group of contacts can be assigned to the campaign

Like other CiviCRM objects, it has types and statuses

Useful for grouping different activities under the same banner

#### What is a petition?

Primarily a way to collect signatures online.

Other information can be collected via a contact profile and an activity profile

#### What is a survey?

A way of administering offline data collection. Offline means

- via a phone banking
- on the go using CiviMobile

Survey also has functionality for working with teams people carrying out the surveys, i.e. ability to reserve respondents to specific individuals.

#### Petitions vs. surveys

Petition is not an online survey. It is a petition. And is optimised as such.

If you want to collect online data from individuals, you would be better off using webform.
